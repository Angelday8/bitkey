- Printer support
  
  For printing paper wallets. Need to look into how other live
  distributions handle automatically setting up the printer 

  Knoppix claims to have built-in support for hundreds of printers:

- Deterministic builds 

  Improve TurnKey's build chain  to support Gitian-style deterministic
  builds, to make it harder to compromise the build process, allow the
  community to independently verify full system integrity bit-for-bit,
  and create a community based signed chain of trust for each released
  version.  

- More multi layered security for increased attack resistance in online mode:

  Implementing exotic security mechansims such as mandatory access
  control (MAC), PAX, trusted path execution (TPE), position independent
  code address space layout randomization (PIE-ASLR), discretionary
  access control (DAC), jails, exploit countermeasures (ECM) and raw
  IO/Memory protections.
