Our vision for `BitKey`_ is a portable device that a computer can boot from,
containing a read-only prefabricated independent operating system environment
which is engineered from the ground up to prioritize security while maximizing
usability. We're aiming to provide a safe, reliable and easy to use practical
platform for high risk applications such as Bitcoin transactions.

Before creating a new issue on the `Issue Tracker`_, please check to see
if a similar issue already exists. If it does, post a comment showing it
also affects you.  Knowing an issue effects multiple users is useful
when we decide how to prioritize limited development resources. Please

components is right here on GitHub.  Developers with good ideas are
